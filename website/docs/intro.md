# Introduction

Catchphrase helps you internationalize your projects.

:::info
Catchphrase currently only supports CSR _(client-side rendering)_ and not SSR _(server-side rendering)_. This feature will be available in the future.
:::

## Features

- Completly type-safe out of the box
- Translations as code
  - Enables [code-splitting](https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/code-splitting.html) and lazy-loading of translations
  - Easily identify and remove translations that are not needed
  - Rename your translations with ease and without breaking anything
  - Share translations between projects
