# Installation

:::info
The core package (`@catchphrase/core`) is always required.
:::

Catchphrase can be installed by using `npm`, `yarn` or `pnpm`:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="npm" label="npm">

```bash
npm i @catchphrase/core
```

```bash
npm i @catchphrase/react
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="yarn" label="yarn">

```bash
yarn add @catchphrase/core
```

```bash
yarn add @catchphrase/react
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="pnpm" label="pnpm">

```bash
pnpm i @catchphrase/core
```

```bash
pnpm i @catchphrase/react
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::note
There will be a Catchphrase CLI in the future that will make it easier to install Catchphrase.
