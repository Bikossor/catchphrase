title: Use your translations
sidebar:
  order: 4

import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Now that you have created your translations, you can use them in your components.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="react" label="React">

Using the [`withTranslations`](/api/react/withtranslation) higher-order component, you can assign your translations to a component.
This component will then receive a `getTranslations` function as a prop which will return your translations.

:::note
You can assign one translation to multiple components.
:::

```tsx
const withExampleTranslations = withTranslations(exampleTranslations);

const TranslatedComponent = () =>
  withExampleTranslations(({ getTranslations }) => {
    const { Greeting } = getTranslations();

    return <p>{Greeting()}</p>;
  });
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
